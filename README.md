# gopractice
A silly little project to re-familiarize myself with go since I haven't used it in a while.

Uses a ton of overkill to create a stateful web app with a sqlite db, front end web service, and back-end web service.

There's no point to it, and it's not even a fun game, but at least I remember a little more go now, and I have something recent to actually show on my github for a change.
